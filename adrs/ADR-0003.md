# ADR-0003: Hazard Classification for Trust Artifacts

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Email and calendar systems carry trust artifacts
(e.g., headers, invitations, links, metadata)
that can be abused without direct execution.

A formal hazard model is required to classify risk
without inspecting content or surveilling users.

## Decision
The system classifies trust artifacts at the metadata level only.

Artifacts are labeled into the following hazard classes:

- Benign
- Suspicious
- Hazardous
- Quarantined

Classification is deterministic, explainable, and non-interactive.

## Consequences
- No content inspection
- No user profiling
- No behavioral monitoring
- No retaliation or interception

All responses are passive and defensive.

## Governance
This classification model is mandatory across all
BuzzIntell Trust-Zero components.
