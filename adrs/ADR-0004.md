# ADR-0004: BuzzKey Calendar & Email Safety Lock

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Calendars and email systems represent high-trust channels.
Compromise often occurs through implicit trust,
not software vulnerabilities.

A non-interactive safety lock is required.

## Decision
BuzzKey is defined as a Trust-Zero safety lock that:

- Observes machine-level trust artifacts only
- Operates without user interaction
- Does not intercept, modify, or block messages
- Applies defensive containment when hazards are detected

BuzzKey never impersonates users or systems.

## Consequences
- Zero surveillance
- Zero interception
- Zero enforcement actions
- Full auditability at the policy level only

## Scope
This ADR governs all calendar and email trust handling
within BuzzIntell systems.

## Compliance
BuzzKey aligns with Zero Trust principles
and regulator-safe governance requirements.
