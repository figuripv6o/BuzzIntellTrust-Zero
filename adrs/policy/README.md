# Policy

This directory defines safety, privacy, and scope policies for
BuzzIntell Trust-Zero architecture.

Policies describe what the system is allowed and not allowed to do.
They do not implement enforcement or monitoring mechanisms.

All policies are governance-first and privacy-preserving by design.
