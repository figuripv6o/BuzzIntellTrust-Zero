# BuzzIntellTrust-Zero
Purpose: Document and demonstrate constitutional, safety-first handling of
calendar and email trust artifacts under a Trust-Zero, non-interactive model.

Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC  
Trust-Zero Safety Architecture  
(FDF CERTIFIED™ · Governance-First · Non-Interactive)

Buzzomatic Intelligence operates a **silent, defensive, Trust-Zero safety system** designed to protect modern digital surfaces—especially **email and calendar trust channels**—without interception, retaliation, or user surveillance.

This repository documents the **architecture, policies, and compliance posture** that govern Buzzomatic systems.

## 🧭 What This Is

A **non-interactive safety architecture** that:
- Observes **machine artifacts only** (metadata-level)
- Neutralizes trust abuse in email & calendar systems
- Labels and contains hazardous objects safely
- Learns **offline**, inside the firewall
- Protects human privacy by design

**No hacking. No retaliation. No outbound signaling.**

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

This system is governed by formal Architecture Decision Records:

- **ADR-0001** — System Scope & Governance (Baseline)
- **ADR-0002** — Trust-Zero Defensive Containment Architecture
- **ADR-0003** — Hazard Classification & Tagging Taxonomy
- **ADR-0004** — Calendar & Email Safety Pipeline (BuzzKey Lock)

All ADRs are:
- Binding
- Auditable
- FDF CERTIFIED™
- Court-safe and regulator-safe

See `/adrs/ADR-INDEX.md` for the authoritative index.

## 🔐 BuzzKey Lock (Email & Calendar Safety)

BuzzKey Lock protects:
- Calendar invites, updates, subscriptions (`.ics`)
- Tokenized links
- Embedded email objects
- Hidden redirects and payloads
- All actions are local, reversible, and non-destructive.

It works by:
1. Passive discovery (no interception)
2. Semantic hazard tagging (no accusation)
3. PPE-governed containment
4. Offline analysis only
5. Neutral reporting

## ⚖️ Privacy & Law

Buzzomatic systems:
- Do **not** search people
- Do **not** intercept communications
- Do **not** execute untrusted content
- Do **not** contact senders
- Do **not** profile users

Machines are observed.  
People are protected.
Observation is limited to exposed machine artifacts and configuration state.
